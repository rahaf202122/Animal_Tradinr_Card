        Ball pythons are popular pet snakes because of 
        their gentle temperament and manageable size. 
        They are non-venomous constrictors,
         meaning they subdue their prey by wrapping 
         around it. Their unique patterns and vibrant
         colors make them one of the most recognizable
          snake species in the reptile world.
